I've developed a chatbot that uses LangChain to provide intelligent answers based on the content of uploaded documents.
 
It efficiently understands and responds to user queries, making document navigation easier.
 
User Input:
 
The user can either submit a URL or PDF containing a document they want to interact with.
 
+Core Tech:
 
LangChain is a framework that helps break down documents into chunks, then converts those chunks into vectors using Ollama embeddings, and stores them in a FAISS database.
 
It then retrieves the most relevant documents based on the user's query and provides their context to the LLM, enabling it to generate the most accurate and helpful response possible.

The chatbot retrieves context from the documents and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.
 
Libraries like Streamlit help build the web interface, while Ollama runs the models locally for seamless user interaction
 
User Experience:
 
The app allows users to upload documents and ask questions. It returns highly relevant answers based on the context within the documents.
 
For example, asking "What is a vector?" brings up an accurate explanation from the document.
 
This project is all about making information more accessible and relevant to what you need.
 
I hope it adds value by simplifying document navigation for everyone.
